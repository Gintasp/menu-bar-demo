# menu-bar-demo
Basic responsive menu bar from scratch. Viewable at https://gintasp.github.io/menu-bar-demo/

This is a custom top menu bar inspired by Bootstrap and made from scratch using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. Includes hover effects and scales on click with transition. It is responsive and mobile compatible. 

Things I learned:

Got better with JavaScript and Responsive Web Design
Gained deeper understanding on how nav bars work and how to create one
Had fun switching between 'burger' and 'cross' Font Awesome icons with JS
